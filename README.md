## Molecular Dynamics (MD)

### 2D_LJ_MD.py

- Molecular dynamics simulation that models Lennard-Jones particles with periodic boundaries

##### Integration Algorithms Used

- Three time integration algorithms can be implemented: Verlet, Velocity-Verlet, and 2nd Order Runge-Kutta. The code was written to reveal why the 2nd Order Runge-Kutta method is not usually used in MD simulations.
