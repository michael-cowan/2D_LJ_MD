### Molecular Dynamics (MD)

## 2D_LJ_MD.py

Coded a molecular dynamics simulation that models Lennard-Jones particles with periodic boundaries. 

## Integration Algorithms Used

Three time integration algorithms can be implemented: Verlet, Velocity-Verlet, and 2nd Order Runge-Kutta. The code was written to reveal while Runge-Kutta methods are not usually used in MD simulations.
